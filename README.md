An eight puzzle slider game where you must reorganize the tiles to complete the picture.
The repository contains 3 files: a tiles folder, a separate simple slider game, and the slider game.
Run it with necessary extensions and it will open a window where the game lives.
Upload an image, invert controls if needed, and press start. If you get stuck press restart. After completion, controls will freeze and the clock will stop. Press restart or quit.
